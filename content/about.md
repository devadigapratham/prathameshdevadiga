I’m Prathamesh Devadiga, an AI researcher, engineer, and educator pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at PES University, Bengaluru. My focus lies at the intersection of Machine Learning Systems (MLSys), AI Security, and Deep Learning. I’m passionate about building reliable, scalable, and interpretable AI systems rooted in real-world impact and open-source philosophy.

Currently, I’m contributing to **Google Summer of Code 2025** with **UC Santa Cruz**, where I’m building billion-scale high-dimensional vector embedding datasets to benchmark Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms. I also conduct research on **Trustworthy AI and Security** at **Dartmouth College**, focusing on adversarial robustness and secure ML pipelines.

## What I Do

**Research and Development**  
I lead [Ādhāra AI Labs](https://aadhara-ai-labs.vercel.app/), an independent research lab focused on Generative AI, LLM systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We design open-source tools that help bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and production-ready applications.

**Research Work**:
- Deep learning for PDF malware detection at **IIT Indore**
- Applied ML for Social Media research at **Deakin University**
- AI Safety Research at **Dartmouth College** 
- AI Researcher at a *Stealth Startup*. 

**Teaching and Mentorship**  
- Co-instructor for a 30-hour “Deep Learning from Scratch” course at **PESU IO**  
- **Teaching Assistant** for ML courses at **PES University**  
- Mentor at **Women in Data Science (WiDS)**, **Google Developer Student Clubs**, and several AI/ML hackathons

**Engineering and Open Source**  
- Built generative AI workflows at a stealth AI startup  
- Developed a RAG-based Go tool for code review and optimization
